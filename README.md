## The little game I have created
There are different spheres around the scene which need to be picked up by using different parts of our body:

- Yellow sphere --> nose
- Purple sphere --> left wrist
- Green sphere  --> right wrist

## Files I created
I created a prefab model Sphere which contains the script 'HitByBody'. That script is the one responsible for detecting the collision between the sphere and the the parts of the body.
Each part of the body (the squares) have its own TAG (used to determine the coliision).
